Here's a helpful trick: you don't necessarily have to open-source your existing product. Instead, you can create an additional open-source library.

For example, Novu, being a full-stack JS frontend and backend, may have a higher likelihood of gaining a larger number of stars compared to a COBOL library due to differences in usage and popularity. However, it's important to note that even if reaching 20k stars may not be feasible for all libraries, it's still possible to gain a significant number of stars for your library from day 1",
